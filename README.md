## About
This project consists of a suite of functional, end-to-end, and visual UI web automation tests using the [Playwright framework](https://playwright.dev/) and [saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com) as the test web application. 

This project demonstrates the capabilities of Playwright for UI web automation testing. If you are learning Playwright and writing scripts in JavaScript, you can use this repository as a model for your own tests.
